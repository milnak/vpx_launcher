# Visual Pinball X Launcher

 Super simple launcher, designed primarily for my *desktop PC* pinball playing needs.  Might add stuff (machine preview) later.

 Defaults assume that this script and the CSV file are in the "root" of the Visual Pinball folder, i.e. where "VPinballX64.exe" is located, and with subfolders "Tables" and "VPinMAME" in it.
